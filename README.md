# Facial Keypoints Detection

The problem includes the prediction of 15 facial keypoint coordinates on a given input image of different human faces. The implementation will start with a basic model which is considered as acornerstone of the process: AlexNet. Later, it will be
continued by introducing more complex and deeper models by adopting some VGGnet properties. 

The data that was used can be found in test.zip and training.zip folders, while the code is available in the vcs-updated-model.ipynb notebook.

The final model's architecture is as follows:

The below picture represents the facial keypoints that were detected on the test data:
